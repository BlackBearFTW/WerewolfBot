# Werewolf Discord Bot

## What is this
This is a discord bot that adds the ability to play **[The Werewolves of Millers Hollow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Werewolves_of_Millers_Hollow)** into discord.
As of writting this (05-05-2021), This project is still in pre-release.

## Why is this
I initially started making this bot because I enjoyed playing the physical game with my friends, but for various reasons we had a difficult time meeting up for game-night, especially with the ongoing pandemic. Besides that I also wanted to learn more about writing discord bots, since I use discord on a daily basis and I like to automate stuff.
So all of this inspired me to start making this bot.

## How is this
This bot is written in Typescript and is going to be hosted on Heroku. I used the following package:

- discord.js
- mysql2
- dotenv
- uuid

## Regarding contributions
Altho I haven't had any opened issues or merge requests yet, I will only accept contributions after the initial version has been released.
