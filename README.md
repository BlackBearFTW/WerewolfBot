# Werewolf Discord Bot

## What is this
This is a discord bot that adds the ability to play **[The Werewolves of Millers Hollow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Werewolves_of_Millers_Hollow)** in Discord.
As of writting this (05-05-2021), This project is still in pre-release.

## Why is this
I initially started making this bot because I enjoy playing the physical game with my friends, but for various reasons we had a difficult time meeting up for game-night, especially with the ongoing pandemic. I also wanted to learn more about writing discord bots, since I use discord on a daily basis and I like to automate stuff, So all of this inspired me to start making this bot.

## Dependencies
This bot is written in Typescript and is made to be hostable on Heroku. The bot has the following NPM dependencies:

- discord.js: ^12.5.3
- mysql2: ^2.1.0
- dotenv: ^10.0.0
- uuid: ^8.3.2
