Game Logic:
- Every user gets a role (not a discord role).
- You have two categories: villagers & werewolves, everything that is not a werewolf is a villager.
- Werewolves and non-normal villagers, make their move at night, villagers vote at day.
- Everyone is a villager at daytime.
- Each role has some sort of choice to make when its their turn.
- One user gets voted to be lynched at daytime by the other villagers and their card gets revealed,
  if they can't come to an agreement, the vote gets dismissed.
- Werewolves pick one person in the night to murder,
  if they can't come to an agreement, they miss their window of opportunity.
- Game ends when there are either more werewolves or more villagers left.

Roles:
- Villager (Does nothing, besides voting for a suspect).
- Werewolf (Murders a single person each night).
- Seer (Picks one user each night, which they can then see the role of).
- Hunter (Picks one other user to kill while being killed).
- Witch (Has two potions for the entire game, one to kill and one to heal, can be used on any player including herself, but only once).
- Cupido (Picks two users who fall in love, without knowing their role. If one dies, so does the other).

Database:
- Users (user_id (from discord), win count, lose count, death count, played as werewolf count)
- Lobbies (id, guild id, category id, hasStarted)
- Participations (id, user_id, lobby_id, isLeader, role_id)
